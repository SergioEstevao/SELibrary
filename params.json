{"name":"SELibrary","tagline":"Categories and Classes","body":"## SELibrary\r\n\r\nSELibrary is a collection of utility methods and category extensions that I'm standardizing on. This should evolve into a toolset of well-documented and -tested code to accelerate future developments.\r\n \r\n## At a Glance\r\n\r\nContained are several category methods\r\n\r\n - NSString+SEAdditions - various utility methods for strings\r\n - NSDate+SEAdditions  - various utility methods for dates\r\n - UIImage+SEAdditions  - various utility methods for images\r\n - UIColor+SEAdditions - various utility methods for colors\r\n - NSThread+SEAdditions - various utility methods to provide block execution funcionality\r\n - NSException+SEAdditions - various utility methods for exceptions\r\n\r\nOther classes simplify common tasks\r\n\r\n - SELogging - common logging and assert macros that are enable/disable in DEBUG/RELEASE builds\r\n - SEAppDelegate - app delegate implementation using a \"service\" approach.\r\n - SETableViewCell - comon code to loading tableviewcell from nib files.\r\n - SEBorderView - a view that allows to define a border. \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is being generated using the AppleDoc tool. If you build the Documentation target it will automatic added the information to your XCode documentation library. \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe SELibrary.framework is using the \"Fake Framework\" template put together by [Karl Stenerud](https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework). If your app does not use ARC yet (but SELibrary does) then you also need the -fobjc-arc linker flag.\r\n\r\n1. Include the SELibrary in your project.\r\n2. Import the SELibrary in your PCH file or include the individual header files where needed.\r\n3. Add -ObjC to \"Other Linker Flags\".\r\n4. In your application target's Build Phases: Link Binary With Libraries phase add the following:\r\n   - CoreGraphics.framework\r\n   - ImageIO.framework\r\n   - QuartzCore.framework\r\n   - SystemConfiguration.framework\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nSergio Estevao\r\n\r\n- http://github.com/SergioEstevao\r\n- http://twitter.com/SergioEstevao\r\n- sergioestevao@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSELibrary is available under the MIT license.
